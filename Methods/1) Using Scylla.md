# Automated DLL Dumping using Process Dumper Tools

- This approach involves using dedicated process dumper tools to extract DLLs from a running process. This is generally easier and quicker than the manual approach.
- Tools Required: https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/releases; https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump

## Step 1: Identify the Target Process
1) Use a task manager or process explorer to identify the process where the DLL is injected.
2) Note the process ID (PID) or process name for later use.

## Step 2: Dump the DLL
1) Open Scylla and select the target process from the list of running processes.
2) Click "Attach" to attach Scylla to the process.
3) In the "Memory" section, look for memory regions that could contain injected DLLs. Scylla provides a simplified view, highlighting likely DLLs.
4) Select the suspected memory region and click "Dump" to export it to a file.
5) Save the file to a safe location for further analysis.

## Step 3: Validate the Dumped DLL
1) Open the dumped file in a PE analysis tool to confirm it has a valid PE structure.
2) If the file appears to be a valid DLL, you can proceed with further analysis or use tools like IDA Pro to inspect its behavior.
